# PKGenerator_Checker
Generate Bitcoin Private Keys and check them against blockstreams liquid api.  I've tried blockcypher and blockexplorer.com but run into issues with limits that I'm FAAARRR to lazy to work around with a round robin of profile switches or setup a full archival node of my own to fire against. Feel free to fund my 

Stupid Python3 Script that Generates random private keys and checks them in realtime...call this poor mans Mining for BTC - same chances as solo but you could find an address w/ money in it ðŸ¤‘  This is for entertainment only and is designed to demonstrate how IMPOSSIBLE it is to realistically get a collision and take control of someone else's coin...Credits to @Shlomi for the inspiration...

# Instructions

<strong>BIG OL DISCLAIMER</strong>:  I cannot emphasize this enough - this is for **DEMONSTRATION** and **ENTERTAINMENT** purposes ... you will have much better success finding employment, buying bitcoin and holding it than to have this little goofy script find a populated private key with a balance....though if you happen to find a populated address you may as well call the pressess and let em know you beat the odds with that extreme luck.

1. Clone this script - download it or in the terminal use `git clone https://github.com/Frankenmint/PKGenerator_Checker/`
2. Let's install some dependencies!  `pip3 install ecdsa base58 requests cfscrape && pip3 install --user python2-secrets`
3. Navigate to the directory: `cd PKGenerator_Checker`
5. Run it! `python3 PkMaker.py`

# Notes


* What's Going on?:  A random 32 byte Number is generated and encoded into Hex - Basially a number between 1 and 2^256 OR if counting in decimal form: [115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/algebra/exponent.php).  Then, that key is hashed a few times into a public address [according to these standard rules](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/9/9b/PubKeyToAddr.png) and is fired off to blockexplorer.com using their API. The script then prints the balance to the console window.
* I threw this together while following along [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH4m2oS2ratfeNpZAoVwPlQqEr3HgNu7S) and reccomend YOU instead watch through the tutorials for your own benefit and to better grasp what happens at the protocol level for [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org)


~~* I had to use cfscraper to get around the issue of cloudflare on the v2 version of the script which uses bitcoinlist.io this version will scan an entire page at a time of keys..though idk if the underlying site is to be trusted (ie they just tell you the funds are zero and sweep the funds into their own wallet first)~~

TODO: I believe the richlist is down right now but someone offerred a different page which I'll look intoat some point.

Here's a demonstration of it in action
